# Depth-First-Search-Algorithm

  	Walks through directory_to_search recursively, in search
	of a directory with title name_to_find.
   
	Returns a tuple. The first component of the tuple is
	Boolean (True or False); True if found, False if not.
    
	If the search succeeded, the second component of the
	tuple is a Path object for the path that was found.
    
	If the search failed, the second component of the tuple
	is a None-type object.
